#BE4M.de´s ReWorked OHSystem/GHost++ WC3 Hosting Bot

The reworked version is a minor modification of the official OHSystem source.
Mostly tweaks, code maintainance improvements, bug fixes, some new features.
This is a work in progess, so check back from time to time to see new features.
After getting the ghost code to an acceptable level, i will start rewriting the OpenStats Website.
OHSystem is a major modification of the official GHost++ source.
